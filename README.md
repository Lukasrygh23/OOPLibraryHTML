# OOPLibrarySpring

This is a web-based program that can query an IMS database. It can create theoretical Ebooks and temporary 'Licenses' for them. 
This is purely the front end of the program, and cannot run without the Spring database backend running alongside it. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must also have [The front end](https://github.com/Lukasrygh23/OOPLibraryHTML/tree/dev) downloaded and ready to use.

### Installing

No installation is required. Simply run the fat.jar. 

## Running the tests
### Unit Tests 

All of the normal unit tests are self-contained.

The Selenium tests require the chrome browser to be installed and updated to the most recent version, and the front end in Prerequisites to be hosted on a server (Visual studio supports this with some addons).
